I'm Justin. I live in the [Southwest Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Garden,_St._Louis) neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri. I've been in St. Louis for nearly three non-consecutive years (one intervening year spent in Chicago), and I grew up in Houston, Texas.

I think cities are interesting and important, and I've been writing casually about them for years. I'm a civil engineer by education but not vocation.

I'm in the process of migrating my blog posts to this website. You can find my older posts on [Wordpress](https://flyoverurbanist.wordpress.com/), and I'm also quite active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lithiumaneurysm).

My other breadcrumbs on the internet include...
* [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/user/LithiumAneurysm/collection) for my budding vinyl collection
* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lithiumaneurysm) for my occasional bursts of charitable productivity
* [RateYourMusic](https://rateyourmusic.com/~lithiumaneurysm), if I ever get around to writing reviews
