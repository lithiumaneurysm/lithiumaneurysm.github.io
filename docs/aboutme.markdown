I'm Justin. I live in the [Southwest Garden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Garden,_St._Louis) neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri. I've been in St. Louis for nearly three non-consecutive years (one intervening year spent in Chicago), and I grew up in Houston, Texas.

I think cities are interesting and important. I'm a civil engineer by education (but not vocation).
